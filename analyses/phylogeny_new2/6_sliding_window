You make 1Mb non-overlapping sliding windows over the file containing all the sequences:
seqkit sliding good_all_sequences.fa -s 1000000 -W 1000000 > sliding_window_leopards.fa

#You make sure that each observation is only in one line
bash all_sequences_one_line.sh sliding_windows_leopards.fa

#I don't know why in the first line there is an empty space, so we remove it:
tail -n +2 sliding_windows_leopards_one_line.fa > sliding_windows_leopards_one_line.tmp && mv sliding_windows_leopards_one_line.tmp sliding_windows_leopards_one_line.fa
