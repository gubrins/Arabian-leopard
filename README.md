##Â Script for PAIR-END WGS DATA!!

To run this script, you have to write all the sample names inside the data.txt file.
The fastq files need to have this structure: 

name_1.fastq.gz

name_2.fastq.gz

If it is not in this format, the script will not run!!

# Softwared required:
## bwa

## samtools

## picard

## gatk

If you run this in Pristurus, you should not have any problems! :)
