# Arabian leopard NGS project
Welcome to the repository for our publication about the Arabian leopard. 
In this repository, you will be able to find all the code we used for our publication on the conservation genomics of the Arabian leopard.

You can obtain our two new whole-genomes of the Arabian leopard here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA924233 

In this repository, you will find two different folders, the first called processing_data is where you can find scripts related with the filtering of the raw data, the snp calling using GATK, the filtering of the vcf file or the calculation of the coverage for the different samples.

In the second folder, called analyses, where you can find all the scripts for the different analyses we implemented in the publication.

Please, if you have any doubts, contact me at gabri.mochales@gmail.com
