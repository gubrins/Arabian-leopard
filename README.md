# SNP-calling-WGS
To run this script, you have to write all the paired-end samples names inside the data.txt file.
The fastq file FOR PAIRED-END DATA need to have this structure: 

name_1.fastq.gz 
name_2.fastq.gz

If the name is not in this format, the script will not run! :(

# Softwared required:
## bwa

## samtools

## picard

## gatk

If you run this in Pristurus, you should not have any problems! :)
